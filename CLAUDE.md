# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Six universal Claude Code commands for design teams, backed by a 4-layer knowledge system. See spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-13-pluginos-integration-and-ds-decoupling.md`.

**Commands:**
- **`/creative`** (`skills/creative/SKILL.md`) — Visual direction, moodboards, palettes, typography, layout systems, imagery/art direction, design refreshes, brand architecture
- **`/ds-make`** (`skills/ds-make/SKILL.md`) — DS creation and lifecycle: tokens, components, deprecation, versioning
- **`/ds-manage`** (`skills/ds-manage/SKILL.md`) — DS operations: publish cascade, analytics, documentation generation, health monitoring
- **`/design`** (`skills/design/SKILL.md`) — Product design using an existing DS or design language; never creates new components
- **`/design-review`** (`skills/design-review/SKILL.md`) — Evaluate designs against heuristics, a11y, DS compliance, visual quality, motion
- **`/map-design`** (`skills/map-design/SKILL.md`) — Extract design language from any artifact and generate DESIGN.md

**L3 Specializations (Enterprise DS):**
- **DS Producer** (`skills/ds-producer/SKILL.md`) — Delegated to by `/ds-make` at L3 (enterprise DS detected)
- **DS Consumer** (`skills/ds-consumer/SKILL.md`) — Delegated to by `/design` at L3 (enterprise DS detected)

**Knowledge system (4 layers):**
- L1: `skills/shared/knowledge/core-principles.md` — always loaded into every sub-agent
- L2: 15 domain files in `skills/shared/knowledge/` — loaded per sub-agent as needed
- L3: 6 curated CSVs in `skills/shared/data/` — queried on demand via Grep, never pre-loaded
- L4: `DESIGN.md` (project root) / `.ds-context.md` — project-specific context

## Tech Stack

- **Design:** Figma — inspect via PluginOS (installed as a peer Claude Code plugin; see `skills/shared/figma-adapter.md` for routing and `skills/figma-setup/SKILL.md` for install)
- **Code:** React, ArkUI, Zag.js
- **DS Documentation:** uSpec (`github.com/redongreen/uSpec`)
- **Project management:** Shortcut (tickets, changelogs)
- **Figma plugins:** PluginOS Bridge (MCP transport — required, install from Figma Community); any DS-specific lint plugin is configured in `.ds-context.md` under `governance.lint.tool`

## Key Architecture Decisions

- Each command is a single SKILL.md acting as a router to inline sub-agent sections
- Commands detect project maturity (L0 Greenfield → L3 Enterprise) before routing; behavior adapts per level
- At L3 (Enterprise DS), /ds-make delegates to ds-producer and /design delegates to ds-consumer — the L3 skills are specializations, not replacements
- L3 CSVs are never pre-loaded; sub-agents query them on demand via Grep when a specific finding needs backing
- /design and ds-consumer NEVER create new components — gaps route to /ds-make
- Publishing follows cascade: Foundations → Components → Patterns → Squad Patterns → Final files; each level must pass QA before the next publishes
- DRY: knowledge lives in `skills/shared/knowledge/`; commands cross-reference, never duplicate

## Interaction Pattern

All commands ask 2-3 questions before non-trivial tasks. Skip when prompt is specific and unambiguous. Team has varying Claude Code experience.

## Conventions

- All research notes and plans go in `docs/`
- Skills target the entire design team as audience
- Optimize for accuracy, quality, and token efficiency
